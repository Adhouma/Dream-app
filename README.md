Well documented example for learning purpose: Spring Boot for implementing a RESTful backend, and Angular + Angular material for creating a JavaScript-based frontend

This web application's functionality will be pretty simplistic indeed. It will be just narrowed to fetching and displaying a List of JPA entities from an in-memory H2 database, and persisting new ones through a plain HTML form.

# Test the app
Download or clone the project <br />
## Backend
Open the Java Backend folder (javaSpringBackend) on your favorite editor example(eclipse) <br />
Run class JavaSpringBackendApplication.java <br />
Open the browser on URL = http://localhost:8080/dreams <br />
## Frontend
Open the Angular frontend folder (angularFrontend) on Git Bash <br />
Type ng add @angular/material (install Angular material) <br />
Type npm install <br />
Lunch the Angular app with ng serve --open <br />
